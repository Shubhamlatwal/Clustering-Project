# A data Driven Approach To Fund Allocation for Help International NGO

## Introduction
In a world where the distribution of resources often does not align with needs, identifying the most effective allocation of funds is crucial for NGOs like Help International. This project leverages clustering models, specifically K-means and Agglomerative clustering, to analyze and categorize countries based on their socio-economic factors. The goal is to optimize the utilization of funds raised by Help International by identifying which countries require the most support.
